# Press F language

------
**Work in progress.**

------

This is a simple language that I'm experimenting with.<br>
It's inspired by the Python, Go, and Rust languages.<br>
For now, only the parser and lexer are implemented.

## Documentation

Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/nomilkinmyhome/pflang/blob/main/docs.md) for more information.

## Run
You can run the parser on a file with the following command:

```bash
./pflang test_script.pf
```
